Open VS Code.
Open the folder or workspace containing your project files.
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
Type and select "Git: Initialize Repository" and choose the root folder of your project.
Alternatively, open a terminal (View > Terminal or Ctrl+`) and navigate to your project folder. Run:
csharp
Copy code
git init
Making Commits:

Stage Changes:

In VS Code, open the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar (or press Ctrl+Shift+G).
